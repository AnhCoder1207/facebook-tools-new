You are the Bob Ross of knife making. Relaxing voice, video well edited, and turns out a beautifull knife
Man I've watched this video so many times and it still amazes me thanks for sharing
This is pretty darn cool.  Don't make knives, just use em' and this video makes me want to take up yet another hobby!  Wonder if you could try this technique using small stainless steel nuts?
Great video
What a unique and gorgeous knife! Well done!
Wow that pattern is sick! It looks like microbes under a microscope, and as a geneticist, I love it! I wish I had that knife.
To me, knives of such caliber are more works of art than ANY painting could ever be! Beautifully well done!
Interesting technique.  I would be interested in seeing the same technique done with high carbon ball bearings!
Gorgeous knife! wish I could do something like this! Keep up the great work!!
Very cool! I hadn't ever heard of this technique. It gives a great effect. The oak burl and the work on the spine was nice. Thanks for your effort— much appreciated!
Fantastic video and what a great result - never thought of this as an option for pattern steel. Thanks!
Forging seems soo fun and a great way to make a lot of your own stuff
Cool. But can you make fish hooks out of a knife?
Wow, it came out absolutely beautiful! If I were to even remotely attempt to make a knife I wouldn't even know where or how to begin, lol. I really respect the process and all the hard work you put in, very much.
Great video and beautiful knife. Love those handle scales as well!
wow if i had equipment like you, i'd never stop making things like these. Great video man!
That's a beautiful knife. I love fishing and seeing a knife made out of fishing hooks is crazy. Amazing job
I signed in yesterday and saw about 5 very interesting videos on my page. I'm old school, I wrote them down so I didn't lose them (any avid Tuber knows how easy that is). Very glad I found this. This "container forging" seems to have infinite possibilities. I bet some small and medium sized gears would make for an interesting pattern. Addition of carbon would be easy too. Excellent craftsmanship and that was 13 minutes of pure enjoyment.
What an incredibly well done video, great step-by-step advice as to some of the pitfalls and the narration and resolution of this was outstanding. Gives people a perspective on how much work went into making one off items in the days before mass production, pretty daunting. You didn't want to lose your knife  in those days you can believe that
As an angler... that's an expensive ass blade! Where'd you buy the hooks?
This is superb; the knife itself, the ideas, and the presentation. Thank you.
Love the videos, you always have a new creative idea and the final product looks incredible! this may be a higher skill level but i would love to see you make a karambit Knife out of connecting rod, don't really know any major shortfalls that would become evident with this design but i feel like it would be a fun project!
Loved watching this project. I’m hoping to get into forging soon. Looking at your process I’m wondering if you could use large fish hooks and lay them all flat in your canister (meticulous I know) which is laid on its side instead of top to bottom. Pouring your steel powder as you go. I will definitely follow your process and try this when I finally have my own shop set up. GREAT CHANNEL
This knife making videos are so cool. That one finished up absolutely beautiful.
really wish i had the tools to do this myself, such a nice knife!
The sped up sound of you hammering the pins in is so satisfying
Beautiful work and excellent craftsmanship !!
I am an avid fisherman and would love to own a knife made out of fishing hooks. just wondering what would it cost to have one custom made like that ?
Wow! That's really Gorgeous! I really enjoy watching a true Craftsman at work, and it's a huge Bonus to have you narrate what you're thinking about as you create this knife. I learned a lot from this video! Thanks Much!
What an inspiration! I'd love to have the opportunity to do this
Pretty freakin cool. Been watching a lot of these etching videos lately. Beautiful work, bud
